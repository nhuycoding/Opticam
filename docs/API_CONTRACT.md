# Backend API reference

Base URL local: `http://localhost:8000`. OpenAPI/Swagger UI: `/docs`.
Pydantic request models are implemented in `backend/main.py`; optimizer logic is in
`backend/greedy_optimizer.py`. All dimensions/distances are meters and angles are degrees.
Coordinates use the top-left origin, with +X right and +Y down; pan 0° points along +X.

## Status and integration

The React UI calls `POST /api/v1/optimize` through Vite's `/api` proxy. If the request times
out after 1.5 s or fails, the UI runs its client-side Greedy optimizer. Layout Save/Load,
BOM JSON/CSV/XLSX, and backend bundle Import/Export routes are implemented but are not
connected to buttons in the current UI. The UI's own layout and bundle JSON actions run
locally in the browser.

## Shared layout schema

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "name": "Cửa hàng",
  "widthM": 10,
  "heightM": 6,
  "gridM": 0.5,
  "obstacles": [
    { "id": "shelf-1", "type": "shelf", "x": 3, "y": 2, "w": 2, "h": 0.6, "elev": 1.8, "angle": 0 }
  ],
  "risk": { "4_6": 5 },
  "cameras": [
    { "id": "CAM-01", "x": 0, "y": 3, "pan": 0, "fov": 85, "res": 2560, "range": 10, "height": 2.4 }
  ]
}
```

`widthM` and `heightM` must be 3–40 m; `gridM` 0.1–2 m; a layout is limited to 12,000
cells by the dimension-based validation. Obstacles support `shelf`, `pos`, or `entrance`;
`w` and `h` must be positive. Extra layout/obstacle properties are accepted. Camera values
are generic dictionaries, so camera-level constraints are not validated by Pydantic.

The frontend import normalizer additionally accepts legacy aliases:
`width|widthM`, `height|heightM`, `grid_size|gridM`; obstacle `w|width`, `h|height`,
`elev|elevation`, `label|name`; camera `pan|pan_angle|angle`. These are frontend compatibility
rules, not a promise that every API request alias is normalized.

## `GET /api/v1/health`

Returns `{"status":"ok"}` when the API process is responsive.

## `POST /api/v1/optimize`

Optimizes camera locations from the supplied layout and matrices. The frontend creates
the matrices using `buildZones()`; blocked cells are excluded from coverage calculations.

```json
{
  "cameraBudgetK": 3,
  "layout": {
    "version": "1.0", "name": "Demo", "widthM": 10, "heightM": 6, "gridM": 0.5,
    "obstacles": [],
    "risk": {},
    "cameras": []
  },
  "grid": { "rows": 12, "cols": 20, "cellSizeM": 0.5 },
  "riskMatrix": [[1, 1, 5]],
  "blockedMatrix": [[0, 0, 0]]
}
```

The matrix snippets above are illustrative only; actual matrix dimensions must be exactly
`rows × cols`. `cameraBudgetK` is 1–20. `cellSizeM` must match `layout.gridM`, and grid
dimensions must equal `round(heightM / cellSizeM)` rows and `round(widthM / cellSizeM)`
columns. Risk values are 1, 3, or 5; blocked values are 0 or 1. The grid may contain at most
12,000 cells. Candidate evaluations are capped at 1,000,000; the optimizer coarsens wall
anchor spacing when required.

Backend candidate cameras use fixed `FOV=85°`, `res=2560` horizontal pixels, `height=2.4 m`,
`range=10 m`; anchors are on room walls, at `max(gridM, 0.5 m)` spacing initially, with pan
angles in 15° increments. Greedy maximizes weighted DORI gain and stops at 95% of unblocked
cells reaching Detection (25 PPM), no positive-gain candidate, or the budget. This is not
the same candidate set or stopping rule as the client optimizer; exact formulas are in
[FORMULAS.md](FORMULAS.md).

Response shape:
```json
{
  "cameras": [
    { "id": "CAM-01", "x": 0, "y": 3, "pan": 45, "fov": 85, "res": 2560, "range": 10, "height": 2.4 }
  ],
  "metrics": {
    "weighted_coverage_pct": 70.0,
    "area_coverage_pct": 80.0,
    "target_coverage_reached": false,
    "target_coverage_pct": 95.0,
    "cameras_used": 1,
    "runtime_ms": 120.0,
    "anchor_step_m": 0.5
  }
}
```

Metrics are example values, not a fixed result. `area_coverage_pct` is the percentage of
unblocked cells at ≥25 PPM. `weighted_coverage_pct` is the achieved weighted DORI score as a
percentage of the maximum possible score. `target_coverage_reached` indicates whether the
95% area target was met.

## `POST /api/v1/layouts/save`

Body: a shared layout JSON. Query parameter `filename` defaults to `layout_v1.json`.
Returns `{"status":"success","saved_file":"..."}`. Files are stored in
`backend/storage/layouts/` by default; set `OPTICAM_DATA_DIR` to use another directory.
The filename is restricted to ASCII letters, numbers, `.`, `_`, and `-` (up to 100 basename
characters), with `.json` appended when absent.

## `GET /api/v1/layouts/load?filename=layout_v1.json`

Returns the validated layout JSON. Returns 404 if the file is absent and 422 if stored
contents cannot be parsed as a valid layout.

## `POST /api/v1/bom/export?format=json`

Body: a shared layout; BOM rows are generated from its `cameras` array. `format` supports
`json` (default), `csv`, or `xlsx`. JSON returns `rows`, `totalCameras`, `totalCableM`,
`totalCameraPowerW`, `recommendedPoeBudgetW`, `totalCostVnd`, and `poePorts`. Camera layouts
may include `powerW`; omitted power uses the documented 12 W planning assumption, while
non-positive/non-finite explicit values return 422. CSV/XLSX are attachment downloads.
Cable length, PoE reserve, and estimation assumptions are described in [FORMULAS.md](FORMULAS.md).

## `POST /api/v1/project/export?download_file=false`

Body:
```json
{ "layout": { "...": "shared layout schema" }, "score": {} }
```

Returns a JSON bundle with `format: "opticam-bundle"`, version, export timestamp, layout,
score, calculated BOM, and heatmap. Set `download_file=true` to receive
`opticam_bundle.json` as a download. This backend-generated bundle includes a heatmap;
the browser's local bundle format may not.

## `POST /api/v1/project/import`

Multipart form upload with field `file`, a `.json` bundle whose top-level `format` is
`opticam-bundle` and whose `layout` matches the shared layout schema. Maximum upload is
5 MiB. Returns `status`, a message, and the validated `project_bundle`; the endpoint does
not persist it or update the browser UI by itself.

## Errors and local development

- `400`: invalid filename or uploaded file extension.
- `413`: project bundle exceeds 5 MiB.
- `404`: requested saved layout does not exist.
- `422`: invalid request/schema, matrix dimensions/values, malformed bundle, or invalid saved layout.
- CORS allows the local frontend origins on ports 3000 and 5173. Vite serves on port 3000
  and proxies `/api` to `http://localhost:8000`.

Run backend tests with `python -m pytest .\backend\tests -q` from the project root.
